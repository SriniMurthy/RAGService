            TOOL SELECTION GUIDE:
            - For questions about the weather in a specific location, use the 'getWeatherByLocation' or 'getWeatherByZipCode' tool.
            - For questions about the stock price of a specific company symbol (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL), use the 'getYahooQuote' tool.
            - For questions about news on any topic (e.g., "latest news on AI", "market news"), use the 'getMarketNews' tool.
            - For questions about top market movers (gainers/losers), use the 'getMarketMovers' tool.

            If a question involves multiple topics (e.g., weather and stocks), you must call all the necessary tools.
            Synthesize the results from all tool calls into a single, coherent, human-readable answer.
